## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Edge protection for the portal, off by default: an optional AWS WAF web ACL on its CloudFront distribution (`waf`: the AWS managed common rule set, per-IP rate limits for all paths and for `/api/*`, and a method allow list), or an existing one (`web_acl_arn`); the API stage's throttling as a variable (`api_throttle`); and the `portal_distribution_id` and `portal_web_acl_arn` outputs. The module README covers CloudFront's flat-rate pricing plans, which only the console can subscribe.

- Source adapters (S3 landing, HTTPS URLs, local directory) and an entry-point registry.
- A layered, content-addressed lake: landing, bronze, silver, and gold per ontology version.
- Ontology discovery (resampled, with a stability score), curated immutable releases with change classification and semver checks, candidate capture, revision drafts and delta extraction over a version chain.
- Release renditions: OWL and SHACL, an agent vocabulary, a Neo4j schema and mapping, the extraction tool schema and a JSON-LD context.
- Collections: several corpora in one stack, one ontology each.
- A portal (CloudFront, Cognito, an HTTP API and Lambda) and a local preview server.
- A Terraform stack whose only required input is the admin email, and a CloudFormation launch stack that runs it from the AWS console.
- AgentCore Gateway tools and an example task agent.
- Sample corpora: an original space-missions set (CC0) and a fetch script for the public-domain Sherlock Holmes stories.
