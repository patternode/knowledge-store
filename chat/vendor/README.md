# Vendored scripts

The chat page's Content-Security-Policy allows scripts from its own origin only, so the
ontology page's one library is served from here rather than a CDN.

| File | From | Version | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `d3.min.js` | `dist/d3.min.js` of the npm package `d3` | 7.9.0 | `f2094bbf6141b359722c4fe454eb6c4b0f0e42cc10cc7af921fc158fceb86539` |

To update it, run `npm pack d3@<version>`, copy `package/dist/d3.min.js` here unchanged, and
update this table and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
